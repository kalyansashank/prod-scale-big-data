# Production Scale Big Data Implementation: Week 6
## Introduction
So far, we have made considerable progress in our journey of learning to build an automated data pipeline. As you know we are aiming to solve the problem of false alarms from security cameras with our data pipeline. As part of this exercise, we have seen how we can build an object detection model using Python & TensorFlow, store the required data in Object Storages (like Amazon S3), and have even outlined all the different elements of our pipeline. 

The outline of our Data Pipeline for reference:
